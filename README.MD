# ðŸ“¦ Mini Order Management System (OMS) API

A modular, scalable **RESTful API** for a fictional B2B **Order Management Platform** built with **Express.js** and **PostgreSQL**.  

This API allows **Suppliers** to list products, **Buyers** to place/manage orders, and **Admins** to control the order lifecycle and view analytics.  
Designed to demonstrate **production-grade structure**, **relational DB design**, **role-based authorization**, and **multi-step business logic** (inventory, UOM conversions, order status history).
